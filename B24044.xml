            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Having laid before this Honourable House</head>
            <p>THAT the Glass Manufacture is so improved in <hi>England,</hi> as to outdo all the World, even to a Prohibition thereof.</p>
            <p>That the same, much to the Advantage of this Nation, Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures its own Commodities, and those of a very small value, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Clay, Sand, Ashes, Mageness, Wood, Coals, Red and White Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Imploys many Thousands in Collecting and Gathering the same together.</p>
            <p>That thereby the Crown receives Advantage in the Consuming Bursilla, Pulverene, Pot-ashes, Saltpetre, Smalt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Imported, and pay considerable Custom.</p>
            <p>That to Manufacture our own Commodities (especially so mean things) to turn to so good account as Glass doth, to vend at home and send abroad, and to manufacture Forreign Commodities here, is one of the chiefest Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages <hi>England</hi> can have in the Ballance of Accompt.</p>
            <p>That Forreign Parts, who have for some years indeavoured to attain the same Art from us, now find what Effects so great Duties as 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon White Glass, 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Dozen upon Bottles, being near 70 <hi>per Cent.</hi> must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable have in <hi>England,</hi> do erect Works, and give all possible Encour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the procuring our said improved Manufacture: And to that end, <hi>Ireland</hi> hath laid so great a Duty on Glass, as will prohibit the Importation thereof there, having got some of our Artists there already, and hath sent to Invite some others of our Chiefest Artists over to set up Glass-Houses there, as appears by a Letter from <hi>Ireland</hi> of the Tenth of <hi>February</hi> last, shewn to several Members of this Honourable House, and ready to be produced.</p>
            <p>That little is received, though the Duty is great; inasmuch as it is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not 5000 <hi>l.</hi> is come clear to the Crown the two last Quarters, draw Backs and Sallaries being deducted.</p>
            <p>That there is no probability of Receiving more in the following Quarters, is evident, If we consider that by a printed Paper about Three Weeks ago, given to the Members of this Honourable House by Mr. <hi>Gutteridge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Glass-makers of <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> it appeared they had then near 20000 Dozen o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Bottles by them, which had then paid 1200 <hi>l.</hi> Duty, (for note 'tis Bottles must advance the Accompt, not White Glass) And 'tis most certain there is above 20000 Dozen of Bottles before-hand at other Houses besides what the Glass-seller or Potters have by them unsold.</p>
            <p>So that if there be near 50000 Dozen of Bottles now made before-hand, which has some of them helpt to swell the first Quarters Accompt, it may be easily guest that the following Quarters will produce so little, as there will be no need of asking any other Tax to put in the room of this; for this will answer no end, were there to be as much Glass made in <hi>England</hi> as hath been; But if the Duty continue, it will come to nothing at all in one years time</p>
            <p>That the Artists of this Nation may not be forced out thereof, have by their Petition most humbly represented their Case to this Honourable House, in hopes, the Premisses being considered, they will be graciously pleased to take off the said Duty, by which the said Artists, and the said Manufacture, will be continued in this Nation, and many Thousands of Poor, which depend thereon, keep their Imploys.</p>
